Music has always been a dominant force in the past centuries. Encompassing many different genres and cultures, music has provided another means in which others can learn about themselves or others. While the music industry has experienced a 40% decline globally in the last two decades, with the release of portable audio players and streaming services such as Pandora, Spotify, and Apple Music, the music industry has seen amazing growth. With a nearly 15 billion and rising global revenue this past year, the music industry’s revival seems all but impossible. Additionally, as the Information Age and Internet of Things \(IoT\) phenomenon comes into full swing, we’ve seen the music industry blossom as never been seen before.
