Music has always been a dominant force in the past centuries. Encompassing many different genres and cultures, music has provided another means in which others can learn about themselves or others. While the music industry has experienced a 40% decline globally in the last two decades, with the release of portable audio players and streaming services such as Pandora, Spotify, and Apple Music, the music industry has seen amazing growth. With a nearly 15 billion and rising global revenue this past year, the music industry’s revival seems all but impossible. Additionally, as the Information Age and Internet of Things \(IoT\) phenomenon comes into full swing, we’ve seen the music industry blossom as never been seen before. Thus, there's an ever-growing need for tools that can exhibit connections between musical objects. This is where Poupon comes into play. Its goal is to illuminate the connections between cities, artists, albums, and news. We made the site using Bootstrap, Flask, Python, GCP, and a whole host of other tools. It was difficult to do everything we wanted to \(imagine a site that could agglomerate news from ALL sources...\), but we're happy with what we've been able to accomplish, given that much of the time also has horrendously difficult coursework outside of SWE. Inside this book, you'll find our UML for our database, as well as a link to our report, which has a more detailed explanation of the site's functionality and construction.
