# Self Critiques

+++
@title[Self Critique Pt. 1]
## What we did well
* Website aesthetics: informative and non-cluttered layout
* Database design made the API easy to implement
* API does filter, sorting and pagination on the backend to lessen the load on the website
* Learning tools quickly to finish the project on time

+++
@title[Self Critique Pt. 2]
## What we learned
* Flask has an API manager
* Wrote the API on our own, so had a lot of control
* Test locally before deploying

+++
@title[Self Critique Pt. 3]
## What we could have improved on
* Time management (starting early)
* Could have used a different search library than Postgres
* Better communication between people working on different components

+++
@title[Self Critique Pt. 4]
## What puzzled us
* Issue with Flask serving static pages
* How to override bootstrap's out-of-the-box CSS
* GCP???
* Used Spotify but didn't have "pop christmas"

# Other Critiques

+++
@title[Other Critique Pt. 1]
## What they did well
* Search API returns results grouped by model
* Adding a search at the top of each model page is creative and useful
* Pages render quickly

+++
@title[Other Critique Pt. 2]
## What we learned from their site

+++
@title[Other Critique Pt. 3]
## What they can improve on
* Apiary isn't completely up to date
* Sorting/filtering functionality on the website is a bit non-intuitive
* The URLs on the website aren't hyperlinks

+++
@title[Other Critique Pt. 4]
## What puzzled us
* What are the "filter by" options
